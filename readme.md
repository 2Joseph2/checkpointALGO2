# Insertion Sort Implementation in JavaScript

## Overview
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort, but it is more efficient than bubble sort and selection sort in practice.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**:
   - Begin with the second element (index 1) and assume the first element is already sorted.

2. **Sorting Process**:
   - Compare each element with the elements before it and insert it into its correct position among those elements.

3. **Insertion**:
   - Shift larger elements one position to the right to make space for the current element.

4. **Completion**:
   - Repeat until all elements are sorted.

## Steps to Implement
1. **Define the insertion sort function**:
   - Write a function that takes an array as input and sorts it using the insertion sort algorithm.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - Include test cases to verify the correctness of the sorting function with various input arrays, including edge cases like empty arrays and arrays with a single element.

3. **Complexity**:
   - Discuss the time complexity of insertion sort (`O(n^2)` in the worst and average cases, and `O(n)` in the best case for already sorted arrays).

## Usage
- Clone or download the repository.
- Run the insertion sort function with different arrays to observe its behavior.
- Modify the function or integrate it into larger projects as needed.
